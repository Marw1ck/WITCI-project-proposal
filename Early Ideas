**Early Ideas**

An App / Webservice / plugin built around the collation and organisation of short sound clips. (henceforth known as samples.) 

The exact means for this will be solidified through a collaborative process, but the early idea takes inspiration from the plugin XO, a plugin from XLN Audio, primarily marketed at electronic producers which offers a 
unique approach to sample sorting: Samples are arranged in a 2 dimensional map of points, such that each sound is represented by a coloured dot, which are then grouped according to the fundamental frequencies (pitch) present in the samples.
There are several other methodologies by which sounds can be compared in an automated system, the most relevant of which at the time of writing is AI or Machine Learning.
